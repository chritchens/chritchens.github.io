It's been a very long time since I had a personal blog. 

<!-- more -->

It was 2014. Today I had the bold idea of starting a new one. Why now? What was my stream of conscience? I don't remember to be honest. Does it matter? Not that much in my humble opinion.

Now, if you want, enjoy a video of Rick and Morty doing "Get Schwifty" and remember that the new season will start this November. Yes, someone should pay me for this, I know. Yes, it's a ridiculous video, I know. But it's extremely schwifty.

Have fun!
